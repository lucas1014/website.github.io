<h2>I thought...</h2>

<p>
    <br>"I thought you were a girl"
    <br>Yeah-I bet you did
    <br>considering, I wanted to feel pretty
    <br>ambiguous
<p>
    <br>Please, don't go miss-
    <br>gendering me now
    <br>This flow was no accident--
    <br>(Short-shorts look good on you--
    <br>Why wouldn't they look good on me
    <br>and my legs, too?)
