<h2>An Apartment is not a Cave</h2>

<p>An apartment is not a cave
    <br>it's no work of art but what time 
    <br> has made it
    <br>so don't mind the dust,
    <br>soot, cracks,
    <br>chips, musk,
    <br>shivers, shadows, Don't mind the
    <br>bulbs, '70s
    <br>appliances
    <br>they are--Don't mind the fingerprints
    <br>this may be a cavern/cistern, but it
    <br>was a home first and forever
    <br>
    <br>There is no animal urges
    <br>or plexiglass that could
    <br>hold arts at the doorstep
    <br>or keep 
    <br>new friends from
    <br>removing their shoes
    <br>and their toes from
    <br>the gorgeous rug
    <br>
    <br>stalactites won't grow from the ceiling
    <br>waterway runs in pipes
    <br>our toilet may be a tunnel to
    <br>Nowhere, stalagmites of saffron dust from disuse,
    <br>please, ask us where to find the bathroom
    <br>walls lure the servile
    <br>we brought tables and chairs
    <br>down the flights of stairs
    <br>and between us, a locus
    <br>
    <br>a fated meeting in an apartment
    <br>(of course, that happens by chance)
