<h3>8/8/21</h3>
<br>My street (the one I grew up on)
<br>Lakemont Blvd, Cougar Mountain,
<br>Pacific Northwest

<h2>Back Home</h2>
    <br>Our suburb is quiet
    <br>There is nothing interesting about our suburb, when we're 
    <br>seventeen, eighteen, nineteen 
    <br>and trying to remember how our grandparents left the CID
    <br>I remember

    <br>my favorite bedtime memory--
    <br>falling asleep to the soft bang of fireworks
    <br>because the smile tickling my small face
    <br>leaves me dreaming of celebrations, and
<br>
    <br>our markets are our sidewalks
    <br>Lemonade stands in front of front lawns
    <br>Where Jackson St. would expect
    <br>temples, we have greenbelts
    <br>so dense and thick the foliage,
    <br>that you can lose yourself in thought
    <br>
    <br>In the distance, blue-green,
    <br>the original skyscrapers, 5000-some ft. tall
    <br>their true names are as old as time
    <br>
    <br>No freeway; no airport; the streets
    <br>are wide and deserted, and as
    <br>night falls, the air descends, winds whisper
    <br>silence
    <br>for the quiet existence
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
